1. Creating Singleton Classes in Python

        Singleton Classes are to be created for all the managers - CustomerManager, DeliveryAgentManager, RestaurantManager, StrategyManager
        How do we create Singleton classes in Python? 
        Using the __new__ function 

2. Areas for improvement:
        2.1. Making order creation thread safe (orderManager.py)
        2.2. Should wait until a delivery agent becomes available (locationBasedAgentMatching.py)
